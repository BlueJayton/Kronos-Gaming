## Future Improvements
#### - We wish to make the loading faster, particularly on the schedule page, as it has way too many database calls
#### - We also might want to make this into a discord bot somehow so teams can interact and check availabilities in their servers
#### - We want to increase the number of people in a group at a time
#### - We want to add notification options such as email
#### - We want to add email login input and google login authentication

## Issues
#### - Fly.io updated and registering for a new account no longer works
