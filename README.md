## Two things that we enjoyed  
#### -  We enjoyed the process of designing an application from scratch that we were actually interested in and would use ourselves.
#### -  We enjoyed improving our html and css skills when it came to making our app look more professional. In particular we learned alot about containers.

## Two things that we did not or wanted to learn from this project  
#### -  We wanted to learn react however we ran out of time to properly implement it in time
#### -  We struggled with dealing with databases and we did not enjoy having to mess around with them so much.
 
<br>
<br>

## Future Improvements
#### - We wish to make the loading faster, particularly on the schedule page, as it has way too many database calls
#### - We also might want to make this into a discord bot somehow so teams can interact and check availabilities in their servers
#### - We want to increase the number of people in a group at a time
#### - We want to add notification options such as email
#### - We want to add email login input and google login authentication
